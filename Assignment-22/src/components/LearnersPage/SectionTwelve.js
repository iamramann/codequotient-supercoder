                  You can’t find better instructors when it comes to learning
                  software development. Not only they are great teachers with
                  reputable Software Engineer resumes, but they are great guys
                  that you end up becoming good friends with. I highly recommend
                  CodeQuotient to anyone considering a training & placement
                  program.

                  CodeQuotient has been by far one of the best experiences I’ve
                  had so far in my life. A place with a great community and
                  wonderful teachers. I’m pretty sure I learned more in three
                  months there than I did during my entire 4 years at college. I
                  made great friends, and Arun sir is a great mentor.

                  The knowledge, connections, and opportunities I’ve gained from
                  the CodeQuotient experience well exceeded my expectations.
                  CodeQuotient was one of the best professional decisions I’ve
                  ever made.

                  The instructors not only experienced, but proficient in
                  simplifying complex ideas for students. For example, debugging
                  which I always found uninteresting and complex, turned out to
                  be fun interactive session than a simple Q/A.
